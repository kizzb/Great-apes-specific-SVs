# Great-apes-specific-SVs
To date, the structure variation of the great apes' ancestral genome has remained a mystery. Here, using the high-quality genomes of chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, gibbon and macaque, the structural variation that occurred in the great ape ancestor was found. We found that these structural variants primarily affect genes involved in neurodevelopment and provides new insights into the evolution of great apes.
